    ">\"Twitter is one of the most recognisable names in the contemporary tech and media landscapes. At its peak in Q1 2018, it reported 336 million MAU.  Looking to a different measure, December 2013 saw Twitter’s financial peak, with a market cap of $39.34. It has, however, fallen from grace on both counts somewhat in recent years. User numbers fell to 321 million by the end of 2018. We saw a recovery to 330 million in Q1 2019, after which point Twitter has switched to reporting ‘monetizable daily users’, of which there were 145 million in Q3 2019.\"*"

Also December of the vital months in the mentioned years, this point can be used to support any electronic activity on Twitter"
