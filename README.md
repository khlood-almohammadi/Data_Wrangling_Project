# Data_Wrangling_Project
## Introduction :



Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. we will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.


## The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing): 
is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.



## What Software Do I Need?

we need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on our computer. 
    The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. we can install these packages via conda or pip
 - pandas
 - NumPy
 - requests
 - tweepy
 - json

we need to be able to create written documents that contain images and we need to be able to export these documents as PDF files. This task can be done in a Jupyter Notebook, but we might prefer to use a word processor like Google Docs, which is free, or Microsoft Word.
    A text editor, like Sublime, which is free, will be useful but is not required.
