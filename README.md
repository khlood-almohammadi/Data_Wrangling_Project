# Data_Wrangling_Project
Introduction  Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. we will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
